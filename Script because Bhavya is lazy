Hi, so Rishabh Sharma, Neil Sharma, Anish Basu and Bhavya Shah made the COVID-19 Help Center in order to give people assistance
through a support program, a virtual helper and a risk assessment tool. Our website makes use of HTML and CSS. 

Our assistance tool that makes use of a COVID-19 Support Program for Canadians can help with Donations, World Statistics, Domestic Abuse,
Medical Help, Learning/educational resources and finally, Reliable News Sources. All of these images link to information to various resources
helping with COVID-19.

We know that getting access to information is key during 
these difficult times so with the use of Python, panda, datetime and time modules, we were able to develop a program that can remedy this.

For this demo, let us choose option 1 for current data. By fetching data from a CSV file, we can see the confirmed cases, recovered cases 
and deaths. 

Next, through the use of an embed and information provided from the ECDC, we can look at the confirmed cases gloablly with a map and 
we also have a chart representing the data. The following chart below depicts the confirmed cases using global, American and Russian statistics
since they have the highest cases. 

Our COVID-19 Risk Assessment tool makes use of Infermedica models and data collection and with an embed, we were able to set up a test that
allows users to determine whether or not they have COVID-19 and action to take. Lets go through it. 

*****Run through the test and just print the results*************
